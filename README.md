# IO-Divs

Small custom hook/component library using Intersection Observer API to add in "scroll" based animations for React components.
Should work just fine with any class based CSS, all examples are with TailwindCSS, might maybe make a styled-components version in the future

Use, copy, whatever

As a note, if anyone would like to show me how to implement keyframe animations with this I would be your friend forever. Im thinking i'll need another variable that will change once `isVisible` gets set to true, then adding in the animation class.
